To create a blog:

1.  Add the menu in the navbar section of the \_quarto.yml file

    ``` yaml
          - href: blog.qmd
            text: "Blog"
    ```

2.  Create blog.qmd file and a posts folder.

    ``` bash
    touch blog.qmd  
    mkdir posts 
    ```

3.  In the blog.qmd file add the head yml code:

    ``` yaml
    title: "Blog"
    listing:
      contents: posts # Contents will be taken from the posts folder
      sort: "date desc"
      type: default
      categories: true
    page-layout: full
    #margin-header: signup.html
    title-block-banner: "#EDF3F9"
    title-block-banner-color: body
    search: false
    ```

4.  Each blog post should have the proper yaml heading:

    1.  Simple example:

        ``` yaml
        title: "Minimal post"
        description: "Post description"
        author: "Marcelo Rosales"
        date: "2023/03/13"
        categories:
          - news
          - code
          - analysis
        ```

    2.  Example with lightbox filters, and html format

        ``` yaml
        title: "Complete Lightbox Example"
        description: "How to use Lightbox"
        author: "Marcelo Rosales"
        date: "2023/03/13"
        categories:
          - photos
          - lightbox
          - gallelry
        filters:
          - lightbox
        lightbox:
          match: auto
          effect: fade
          desc-position: right
          loop: true
        #  css-class: "my-css-class" #only if custom css file exists. 
        format: 
          html: 
            code-fold: true
            code-copy: true
            code-overflow: wrap
        Editor: Source 
        ```

    3.  There are also specific templates, ex. Jolla template:

        ``` yaml
        title: "Jolla template"
        description: "quarto templates"
        author: "Marcelo Rosales"
        date: "2023/03/16"
        categories:
          - quarto
          - code
          - templates
          
        about:
          id: hero-heading
          template: jolla
          image: images/img01.png
          links:
            - icon: twitter
              text: twitter
              href: https://twitter.com
            - icon: github
              text: Github
              href: https://github.com
        ```

This file is the the "main page" i will called it "landing page" for the blogs.\
this files is in: \~/Documents/GitHub/Quarto/quarto-trials/quarto_website. =\> Can I place this file directly into the posts folder??

All subsequent blog files need to be saved in the posts folder.\
The yml in this file will direct to the folder and the way is displayed.ã€€ In other words, the yml section, the listing for this page comes from the contenst in the foldes posts..."contents: posts"
